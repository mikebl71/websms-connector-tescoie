<h4 id="how_much">How much does it cost to send a text message with this app?</h4>

<p>There are two parts here.</p>
<p>First is the price of the actual WebText. This will be exactly the same as if you sent this message from the website directly.
If you have remaining free WebTexts then this will be free, otherwise you pay whatever Tesco charges you for messages.
WebSMS will show you the remaining balance of your free WebTexts.</p>

<p>The second part is the price of the data exchange between the app and the website.
All the app does is it logs into the website on your behalf and sends the messages from there.
So it has to upload your request and receive some result web pages.
It does try to be clever and avoids images, fonts, certain pages, etc.
However, one message still requires around 37K of data traffic (checked in Aug 2015).
If you are using wi-fi or if you have mobile data allowance, then this will be free for you.
Otherwise Tesco will charge you for this data.
On the Prepay, it's about 2c (checked in Aug 2015).
If you are abroad on roaming, again, this might cost you more.
The safest option is to send one message from the app and then check in your History on the website how much you were charged.</p>

<h4 id="balance">Why is it that WebSMS shows two numbers in the balance for tesco, e.g. "tesco: 150+29"?</h2>

<p>Tesco Mobile has two balances - for National and International webtext messages. That's why there are two numbers.
The first is the balance for National texts and the second is the balance for International texts.</p>

<div class="totop"><a href="#main">Top</a></div>


<h4 id="how_long">How long can a text message be?</h2>

<p>Tesco Mobile does not allow a webtext message to be more than 160 characters.
If you try to send a longer message, this app will automatically split it into several messages of up to 160 characters each.
Note that, in this case, your remaining balance of webtexts will be reduced by the corresponding number of messages.
If you type your message in WebSMS, you will see a counter of how many characters you have typed and how many messages this will require.</p>

<h4 id="non_english">Why is it that I cannot send international (non-English) characters?</h4>

<p>This is a problem with Tesco Mobile website. If you noticed, you cannot send these characters from the website either.
I complained to Tesco several times but I guess they don't think it is important enough to fix this.
Please do send them your complaints as well so that they know that I am not the only one who needs it.
As far as I know, Tesco is the only Irish provider that does not support international characters on their website.</p>
